        <p class="thumbnailDescription">This website was requested by a lawyer looking to completely overhaul their website. The goal was to create a brand-new website with striking but simple visuals - nothing too flashy, yet still engaging. The challenge was creating a page that would give the potential client all of the information they would need to choose the lawyer to represent them yet wouldn't overwhelm them with walls of text or legal jargon. Clients looking for lawyers typically are in a bind, so the website needed to be reassuring without definitively promising anything. Everything about the website was carefully chosen to exude confidence, be reassuring, and display key information such as awards and contact info up front. The result was a professional and responsive website that smoothly works on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>

        <p class="thumbnailDescription">The SHAI Program &#40;WORK IN PROGRESS&#41; is an after-school youth program for inner city boys. They need a site that would appeal to both young kids as well as their parents. It needs to give off a youthful, energetic vibe that would get kids excited for the program while assuring parents that this is a safer option than life on the street. I decided to go with something athletic and assertive, with large and eye-catching images depicting the children engaging in the various activities. Italicized, bold text and upper-case fonts were used for call-to-actions as well as headings while thin and professional looking type was used for anything referencing the Program proper. This would in turn appeal to the parents looking to enroll their children in a program that is not only a healthy environment but also relevant to young boys.</p>

        <p class="thumbnailDescription">This was a project for <span><a href="www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></span>, which required that we make a website built to match precise specifications. We were presented with a .png file containing a full mock up &#40;which can be seen <span><a href="https://github.com/TheMechanist/ColmarAcademy/blob/master/colmar-academy-spec.png">here</a>&#41; </span> of the site, with dimensions and placement rules for all elements. The goal was to match the site as best as possible to the spec, while being efficient and using specific code to demonstrate what we had learned in the course up to that point. It was also designed to test how well we were able to follow the specifications set by another. This demonstrates our ability to work with a client or senior developer who is controlling the design aspect of a project.</p>
